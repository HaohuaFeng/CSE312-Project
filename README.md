# CSE312-Project
To test this web app locally, before running the server.py, please make sure you have MySQL installed.
If your MySQL database has different user name than 'localhost' and needs a password, please modified the line 11-12 of server.py.
Now, all content in the github is ready to be tested in docker, simply run docker compose command. Database and server will be ready to use after then.
Until now, we have complete some basic functionalities, such as register, login, logout, leave a comment (could upload image) in the blog,
forgot password, and modify user's profile, etc. Some of them still need to be improved, for example we haven't started to 
require the user to enter complex enough password, we will do that later.
